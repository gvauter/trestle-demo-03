x-trestle-set-params:
    # This section contains the parameters that are part of this control.
  # Each parameter has properties. Only the profile-values and display-name properties are editable.
  # The other properties are informational.
  #
  # The values property for a parameter represents values inherited from the OSCAL catalog.
  # To override the catalog settings, use bullets under profile-values as shown below:
  #
  #   profile-values:
  #     - value 1
  #     - value 2
  #
  # If the "- <REPLACE_ME>" placeholder appears under profile-values, it is the same as if
  # the profile-values property were left empty.
  #
  # Some parameters may show an aggregates property which lists other parameters. This means
  # the parameter value is made up of the values from the other parameters. For parameters
  # that aggregate, profile-values is not applicable.
  #
  # Property param-value-origin is meant for putting the origin from where that parameter comes from.
  # In order to be changed in the current profile, profile-param-value-origin property will be displayed with
  # the placeholder "<REPLACE_ME>" for you to be replaced. If a parameter already has a param-value-origin
  # coming from an inherited profile, do no change this value, instead use profile-param-value-origin as follows:
  #
  #    param-value-origin: DO NOT REPLACE - this is the original value
  #    profile-param-value-origin: <REPLACE_ME> - replace the new value required HERE

# ac-22 - \[Access Control\] Publicly Accessible Content

## Control Statement

The organization:

- \[a.\] Designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system;

- \[b.\] Trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information;

- \[c.\] Reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible information system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included; and

- \[d.\] Reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information {{ insert: param, ac-22_prm_1 }} and removes such information, if discovered.

## Control Objective

Determine if the organization:

- \[AC-22(a)\] designates individuals authorized to post information onto a publicly accessible information system;

- \[AC-22(b)\] trains authorized individuals to ensure that publicly accessible information does not contain nonpublic information;

- \[AC-22(c)\] reviews the proposed content of information prior to posting onto the publicly accessible information system to ensure that nonpublic information is not included;

- \[AC-22(d)\]

  - \[AC-22(d)[1]\] defines the frequency to review the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information;
  - \[AC-22(d)[2]\] reviews the content on the publicly accessible information system for nonpublic information with the organization-defined frequency; and
  - \[AC-22(d)[3]\] removes nonpublic information from the publicly accessible information system, if discovered.

## Control guidance

In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the general public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This control addresses information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the general public, typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-organization information systems is covered by organizational policy.

<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The added parts in the profile for this control are below.  You may edit them and/or add new ones. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://oscal-compass.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
